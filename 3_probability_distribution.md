## Probability Distribution

### 1. What is Probability Distribution
A probability distribution is a function that describes the probability of each possible value of a random variable. It provides a mathematical model for understanding and predicting the behavior of uncertain events.

***Common Types of Probability Distributions:*** 

- Bernoulli Distribution: Models the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., 0 or 1, yes or no).
- Binomial Distribution: Models the probability of k successes in n independent trials.
- Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution): Models continuous values with a symmetric bell-shaped curve.
- Poisson Distribution: Models the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval.
- Uniform Distribution: Models equally likely outcomes over a defined range.
- Exponential Distribution: Models the time between events in a Poisson process.
- Multinomial Distribution: Models the probability of each possible value of a categorical variable.

***Key Properties:***
- Probability Mass Function (PMF): Describes the probability of each discrete value.
- Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): Describes the probability of a value less than or equal to a given value.
- Mean: The expected value of the distribution.
- Variance: The spread or dispersion of the distribution.
- Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance.

### 2. What is Binomial Distribution?

The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with a constant probability of success.

***Properties:***
- The binomial distribution is symmetric if p = 0.5 and asymmetric otherwise
- The mean and variance of the binomial distribution are np and np(1-p), respectively

***Common Applications:***
- Modeling the number of heads in a series of coin tosses
- Analyzing the number of defective products in a batch
- Predicting the number of successes in a series of independent experiments
