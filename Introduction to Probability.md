### Introduction to Probability

#### What is Probability?

Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It quantifies uncertainty or randomness associated with a particular event. In the context of machine learning, understanding probability is crucial as it forms the basis for various algorithms and models.

#### Simple Example: Coin Toss

Consider the simple example of tossing a fair coin. The possible outcomes are either heads (H) or tails (T). The probability of getting heads (P(H)) is 0.5, and the probability of getting tails (P(T)) is also 0.5. Here, each outcome is equally likely.

#### Complement of Probability

The complement of an event A, denoted by \( A' \) or \( A^c \), represents all outcomes that are not in event A. The probability of the complement of event A is given by \( P(A') = 1 - P(A) \).

Example:
- Consider the event of getting a head when tossing a fair coin. The complement of this event (not getting a head) is getting tails. Thus, \( P(\text{not getting a head}) = 1 - P(\text{getting a head}) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \).

#### Sum of Probabilities (Union and Intersection of Events)

- **Union of Events:** The probability of the union of two events A and B, denoted by \( P(A \cup B) \), is the probability that at least one of the events occurs. If A and B are disjoint events (mutually exclusive), then \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \).
- **Intersection of Events:** The probability of the intersection of two events A and B, denoted by \( P(A \cap B) \), is the probability that both events occur simultaneously.

Example:
- Suppose we have two events: Event A is rolling an even number on a fair six-sided die, and Event B is rolling a number greater than 3. 
  - \( P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \) (since there are 3 even numbers out of 6).
  - \( P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \) (since there are 3 numbers greater than 3 out of 6).
  - As the events are mutually exclusive, \( P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \).
  - The probability of the intersection of A and B (\( P(A \cap B) \)) is the probability of rolling an even number greater than 3, which is \( P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{3} \).

#### Independence of Events

Two events A and B are said to be independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other. Mathematically, for independent events, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \).

Example:
- Consider tossing a fair coin and rolling a fair six-sided die. The outcomes of these two events are independent since the result of tossing the coin does not influence the result of rolling the die.
