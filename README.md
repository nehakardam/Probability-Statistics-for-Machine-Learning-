# Probability and Statistics for Machine Learning

Welcome to the Probability and Statistics for Machine Learning repository! This repository contains materials designed to understand key concepts in probability and statistics essential for machine learning. 

## Introduction

Probability and statistics are fundamental pillars of machine learning. Understanding these concepts is important for developing intuition, building models, and interpreting results. This repository provide a comprehensive introduction to probability and statistics tailored for machine learning enthusiasts and practitioners.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into several sections, each covering different aspects of probability and statistics relevant to machine learning. Below is an overview of the repository:

1. [Introduction to Probability](https://github.com/nehakardam/Probability-Statistics-for-Machine-Learning-/blob/main/1_Intro_to_Probability.md)
   - Understand basic probability concepts such as events, sample spaces, and probabilities.
   - Learn about complement of probability, sum of probabilities, and independence with examples.

2. [Random Variables and Probability Distributions(some part of the topic material will be added soon..)](https://github.com/nehakardam/Probability-Statistics-for-Machine-Learning-/blob/main/2_randomvariables_probabilitydistribution.md)
   - Study common probability distributions including discrete and continuous distributions.
   - Learn about the Gaussian (Normal) distribution and its properties.

### I will be adding material soon for below topics...

3. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Explore measures of central tendency, dispersion, and skewness.
   - Understand histograms, box plots, and scatter plots for visualizing data distributions.

4. **Statistical Inference**:
   - Explore hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
   - Understand the concept of p-values and significance testing.

5. **Linear Regression**:
   - Introduction to simple and multiple linear regression models.
   - Learn about model fitting, interpretation, and evaluation.

6. **Classification**:
   - Understand binary and multiclass classification problems.
   - Explore logistic regression and decision tree classifiers.
